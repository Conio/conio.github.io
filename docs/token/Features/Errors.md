#Â Common errors

List of common errors that can be returned by any service:

- `Unauthorized`: the service launched requires authentication, but there is no valid session
- `OutdatedSdk`: the Conio Token SDK version can no longer be used, you need to update it to a newer version.
- `Unknown`: an unexpected error.
